            Appeal to withdraw the Tender Notice issued by Delhi Development Authority
            to convert Sanjay Vann as an Eco-Tourism hub.
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is in reference to citizens’ appeal to withdraw the Tender Notification issued by Delhi Development
          Authority to convert the Sanjay Vann area as an Eco-Tourism Hub. Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter
          referred to as “DDA”) is planning to utilize the forest area for recreational purposes such as rock climbing,
          paragliding, aerial trails (canopy tours, ziplines, valley crossing, Burma bridge crossing), forest safari,
          leisure cycling, camping, and picnic spots,
          star gazing, bird watching, guided nature tours, and flora and fauna observation trips among other activities.
          It must be noted that Sanjay Vann, is one of the few untouched green lungs of the capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forest is home to several avifauna species and diverse varieties of trees. Because of the same, Sanjay
          Vann
          is frequented by a lot of birdwatchers and also cyclists who come here to ride in and breathe fresh air in the
          morning. Aside from birds that include Eurasian golden oriole, purple sunbird, Asian koel, Brahminy starling,
          Indian silverbill, white-throated kingfisher, Grey-breasted Prinia, crested honey buzzard, rufous treepie, and
          Indian paradise flycatcher, etc, the forest also conserves habitat for jackals, snakes, nilgais and several
          species of butterflies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanjay Vann has already undergone severe degradation in recent times with the proliferation of the
          <u><em>Prosopis juliflora</em></u> tree which is non-endemic to the Aravalli Ranges and has caused depletion
          of
          the groundwater level, killing native flora and changing the natural soil characteristics of the Aravallis.
          Sewage water and effluent which is discharged into Sanjay Vann has also affected this green belt in the
          Capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the recent proposal of DDA to convert Sanjay Vann into an Eco-Tourism hub will deteriorate the only
          left
          green belts of Delhi. The National Capital has already made international headlines for its poor air quality
          every year. Experts have already warned that
        <blockquote>
          <em>
            “Forest areas should be left untouched, as we don't have a lot of genuine forest area left in the capital
            city. Nature trails are already there in Sanjay Vann and anything beyond that would be an invasion of forest
            land.”
          </em>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, as a citizen, I urge you to help restore one the only remaining green patches of the city and prevent
          the
          damage from happening.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Direct the Delhi Development Authority to recall the Tender Notice issued for Eco-Tourism at Sanjay Vann.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to do proper clean-up of the Sanjay Vann.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct SDMC to take strict action against the spilling of garbage, plastic waste at Sanjay Vann.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct SDMC to conduct regular awareness campaigns on sustainability, the climate crisis, and the importance
            of Sanjay Vann for the national capital.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install new waste bins by replacing the old and damaged ones.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Eagerly anticipating an immediate, careful, and most urgent consideration of the above matter from your end.
